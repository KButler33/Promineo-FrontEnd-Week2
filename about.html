                <h2>Professional</h2>
                    <p> I come to the table with a plethora of design experience, not just in web design, but also graphic design, fashion design, and even architectural design. 
                    My first experience with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator began while I was obtaining my AA in architecture in 2001. 
                    After obatining my bachelor's in Marketing in 2008, I continued developing those skills throughout my career as a marketing manager. 
                    In 2014, I returned to school at SUNY's Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC and honed those skills even further, along with adding to my knowledge of design and color principles. 
                    Today, I own my own business doing graphic design and fashion consulting.
